        This 2004 Mazda RX-8 is powered by a 1.3-liter Wankel rotary linked to a
        six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential and is
        finished in Velocity Red Mica over black and red leather upholstery.
        Additional equipment includes 18″ alloy wheels, a rear wing, a glass
        sunroof, reverse-hinged rear doors, heated front seats, air
        conditioning, cruise control, and an AM/FM CD stereo. The car was first
        registered in Pennsylvania, spent time in Maryland, and was acquired by

        at no reserve in Pennsylvania with manufacturer’s literature, service
